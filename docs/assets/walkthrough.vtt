1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We start the development server (with live reload).

2
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000
The home headers, feed events and browse cards are empty divs.

3
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.000
This is the static HTML and CSS for a single card.

4
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.000
We copy-paste it directly in the card control renderer function.

5
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's see the result...

6
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000
The data is all messed up.

7
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.000
We need to replace the hard coded values

8
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
with the control's properties.

9
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We default the like and comment count to 0.

10
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Let's see the result again...

12
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.000
The category ribbon is always black.

13
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We have a property for that as well.

14
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And we use it with the dynamic class array syntax.

15
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Done!
